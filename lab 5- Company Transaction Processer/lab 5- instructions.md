You are to implement a function that processes a list of transactions. The function definition and its parameters are as follows:

process_transactions(transactions, lower_bound, upper_bound)
-transactions: A list of floats.
-lower_bound: A float.
-upper_bound: A float.

The function should return a list of three items:
- The first item is a list containing the transactions lower than or equal to the lower_bound.
- The second item is a list containing the transactions between lower_bound and upper_bound.
- The third item is a list containing the transactions greater than or equal to the upper_bound.
