#CENG240 Lab Works
*Hello This Repository is Consisted of my CENG240 Python For Engineering Students(METU DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER ENGINEERING) Course*

In this repository you can find my **individual solutions** for assignments given for me to do it within 1 hour (except lab 9 which I required to complete it within 3 hours)

- In each file you can find the instruction given to me as .md file and my solution as .py file

- **Note that I did all these works(except lab 9) without being able to search anything on the internet. Every assignment was done on the Safe Exam Browser(SEB) with zoom camera open on my side. I coded programs on moodle system of our university and Online Python Emulator of METU CENG Department**

- I thank all my proffesors and teaching assistants of CENG240 course for learning a lot out of this course especially on these labs.
