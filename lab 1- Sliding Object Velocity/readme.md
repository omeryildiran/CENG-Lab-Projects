Sliding Object

![Depiction](sliding_object.svg)


An object with mass M is released from a height of h meters from the ground with an initial speed v0=0m/s. You can assume that, after passing the point a on the ground, the object's potential energy (at height h) is fully converted to kinetic energy without any loss.

You can calculate the potential energy (PE) and the kinetic energy (KE) of the object as follows:

PE=Mgh,

KE=12Mv2,

where g is the gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s2).

Write a program that finds the speed of the object, v, at point a where h will be given by the user as a floating point number. Your program should print the result as a float with at most 2 digits after the decimal point.
